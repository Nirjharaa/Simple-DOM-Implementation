# Simple-DOM-Implementation
A simple DOM (Document Object Model) in a full-stack application refers to the representation of the document's structure and content that the application can interact with programmatically. This simple example includes an HTML structure with a button and a content div. CSS styles provide some basic styling, and JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM by changing the content dynamically when the button is clicked.
